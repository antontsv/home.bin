# Scripts and executable files

Your can copy desired script to any location in your PATH
or install to ~/bin with [homeshick](https://github.com/antontsv/homeshick)

Some of the scripts are using `#!/usr/bin/env awesome-bash` shebang,
which requires [awesome-shell installation] (https://github.com/antontsv/awesome-shell#installation)

# Completion

Completion rules can be found in `.sh` directory,
if you use one-time [homeshick-based setup](https://github.com/antontsv/.files#comprehensive-setup),
completion rules will be installed and kept up-to-date automatically

Made with ðŸ’—  for your $HOME/bin
